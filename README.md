# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm KL0-6

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a recent high school graduate pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a passion for low-level programming, backend development, AI-powered applications, and hardware.

## ðŸš€ My Journey into Tech

From a young age, I was fascinated by how things worked. This curiosity led me to explore hardware, where I spend countless hours tinkering with my computer and watching [LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips). My interest in hardware naturally led me to tinkering around with software.

Toward the end of Middle School (Covid lockdown), I began learning programming languages like C++, which opened up a whole new world. My passion for creating efficient and powerful applications grew, leading me to focus on low-level programming.

Now, I try to explore every aspect software has to offer including frontend, backend, mobile applications, pentesting, and of course, desktop applications.
